This repository contains a Dockerfile that caused a build error due to a missing requirements.txt file. The corrected Dockerfile addresses this issue.  The original Dockerfile incorrectly assumed the existence of a requirements.txt file, which was not included in the build context. This resulted in a build failure. The corrected version checks for the file's existence before attempting installation or handles it appropriately. This example demonstrates the importance of carefully considering file paths and dependencies when creating Dockerfiles.
